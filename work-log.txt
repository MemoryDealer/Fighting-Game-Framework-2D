-The main must have parameters argc and argv for SDL to link properly, not sure if calling main SDL_main is necessary. 
-Got textures loaded; SDL_Texture stores the texture in memory, SDL_RenderCopy() renders the texture and allows specification of 
	coordinates, SDL_QueryTexture() gets a texture's width and height, SDL_RenderPresent() flips the screen, if I understand correctly. 
-SDL_Texture's should be destroyed with SDL_DestroyTexture(),
	same goes for the renderer, and window. 
-Added SDL_image extension, several DLL files are needed (five) for it to work with the executable. 
-Calling IMG_Init() will preload the library to later prevent performance hiccups when using it. 
-Added SDL_ttf library to load true type fonts.
